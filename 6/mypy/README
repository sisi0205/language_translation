Project description: 

Paramter:
I implemented the parameters by adding ArgNode() and ParameterNode(), in both Node have a vector<Node *>. And both of them have insert() member function to puch_back Node*.  Using "dynamic_cast" to add push_back node into vector in parser.y. 
I also add another vector<FunctionTable> in tableManager to keep track of parameter in function.
After pushscope, I dynamic_cast to call fucntion geteval() in ParameterNode(). In getvval() function I pair the paramter and corresponding argument, insert them into symboltable in currentscope. 

Recursive:
I got recursive for free after impelemented paramters. 


Default value: 
I added a virtual funciton getIdent() in Node(), and redefine the getIdent in IdentNode() and AsgBinaryNode() to get the name of string when pair the paramter and corresponding argument. 


Problems that I had in completing this project:
